# Archived Documentation

This folder contains superseded, planning-only, or deprecated documentation that is not part of the active source-of-truth set.

## Archive Rules

- Files here are historical context only.
- Do not use archive docs as implementation authority.
- Active docs are listed in `docs/INDEX.md`.

## Why files were archived

Most files in this folder were archived for one or more reasons:

- Pre-consolidation duplicates of requirements/specs
- Time-bound planning drafts
- Deprecated interaction or test planning docs
- Content that conflicts with the current 110-card baseline
