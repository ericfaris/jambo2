# Roadmap

Last reviewed: 2026-03-01

## Now

- Stabilize rules fidelity and resolution safety
- Strengthen AI-vs-AI evaluation and balancing loops *(Expert vs Hard: 70% combined — target met)*

## Done (this cycle)

- **Harden docs** — CARD_REFERENCE.md, CLAUDE.md, and CardDatabase.ts fully cross-checked; all three sources consistent
- **Rules audit** — every card's gold values, ware counts, and interaction timing verified; Traveling Merchant corrected to match digital implementation
- **Stall prevention test coverage** — resolver guards and validation gates covered for all 22 resolution types (Portuguese, Psychic, Tribal Elder, Shaman, Elephant draft, Supplies, Wise Man, Arabian Merchant, Parrot full-market, Throne full-market, Cheetah 0g opponent, plus earlier Well/Basket Maker/Carrier)

## Next

- Expand multiplayer robustness and reconnect behavior
- Improve UX clarity for complex interaction prompts
- Tighten persistence compatibility and migration coverage

## Later

- Deeper AI strategy tiers (smarter Expert rollout policy, endgame awareness)
- Additional polish for visuals/audio/accessibility
- Optional analytics and telemetry for balancing workflows
