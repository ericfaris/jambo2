## Now

- Stabilize rules fidelity and resolution safety
- Strengthen AI-vs-AI evaluation and balancing loops
- Harden docs as a single-source-of-truth system
- **Stall prevention test coverage** — systematic edge-case tests for all 22 resolution types (empty supply, full market, empty hand, zero wares)
- **Rules audit** — verify every card's gold values, ware counts, and interaction timing against the physical rulebook

## Next

- Expand multiplayer robustness and reconnect behavior
- Improve UX clarity for complex interaction prompts
- Tighten persistence compatibility and migration coverage

## Later

- Deeper AI strategy tiers (smarter Expert rollout policy, endgame awareness)
- Additional polish for visuals/audio/accessibility
- Optional analytics and telemetry for balancing workflows
